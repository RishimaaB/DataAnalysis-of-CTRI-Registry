# DataAnalysis-of-CTRI-Registry
The primary goal of this study is to determine how many trials a given Principal Investigator (PI) in India has conducted.

For this project, we used R-script to obtain all clinical trial records from the CTRI registry, followed by web-scraping for the needed information and filtering the pertinent data using MS-Excel tools.

This folder contains the R-script required for web scraping the desired information.

Because work on this project is still in progress, we will update the conclusion once it is completed.
