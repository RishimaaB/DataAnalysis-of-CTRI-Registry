# Data Analysis of CTRI Registry
Clinical trials conducted in India have been criticized on several counts over the years. In response, several years ago, the government limited the number of trials per Principal Investigator (PI) to no more than three at a time. However, subsequently, this rule was revoked. In 2011, it was noted with concern that there was a PI who had run as many as 25 trials in India, and in 2016 it was noted that a clinician had simultaneously run 10-15 trials. In order to determine how widespread such a phenomenon has been, we investigated how many trials a given PI had run in India.

For this project, we used R-script to obtain all clinical trial records from the CTRI registry, followed by web-scraping for the needed information and filtering the pertinent data using MS-Excel tools.

This folder contains the R-script required for web scraping the desired information and python scripts for cleaning and analyzing the data.
